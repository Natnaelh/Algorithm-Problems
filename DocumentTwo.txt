What separates pseudocode from “real” code is that in
pseudocode, we employ whatever expressive method is most clear and concise to
specify a given algorithm. Sometimes, the clearest method is English, so do not
be surprised if you come across an English phrase or sentence embedded within
a section of “real” code. Another difference between pseudocode and real code
is that pseudocode is not typically concerned with issues of software engineering.
Issues of data abstraction, modularity, and error handling are often ignored in order
to convey the essence of the algorithm more concisely.
(b) [4 pts] It is actually possible to express each of the above using only nand, without
needing to use ¬. Find an equivalent expression for ( ¬ A) using only nand and grouping
parentheses.
(c) [8 pts] The constants true and false themselves may be expressed using only nand.
Construct an expression using an arbitrary statement A and nand that evaluates to true re­
gardless of whether A is true or false. Construct a second expression that always evaluates
to false. Do not use the constants true and false themselves in your statements.
Problem 4. [10 points] You have 12 coins and a balance scale, one of which is fake. All
the real coins weigh the same, but the fake coin weighs less than the rest. All the coins
visually appear the same, and the difference in weight is imperceptible to your senses. In at
most 3 weighings, give a strategy that detects the fake coin. (Note: the scale in this problem
is a scale with two dishes, which tips toward the side that is heavier. For clarification, do an
image search for “balance scale”).
Problem 5. [6 points] Prove the following statement by proving its contrapositive: if r is
irrational, then r 1/5 is irrational. (Be sure to state the contrapositive explicitly.)
Problem 6. [12 points] Suppose that w 2 + x 2 + y 2 = z 2 , where w, x, y, and z always
denote positive integers. (Hint: It may be helpful to represent even integers as 2i and odd
integers as 2j + 1, where i and j are integers)
Prove the proposition: z is even if and only if w, x, and y are even. Do this by considering
all the cases of w, x, y being odd or even.
